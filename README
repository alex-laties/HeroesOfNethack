Heroes of Nethack is a cooperative online nethack-style game, built to run in the browser!

Why in the browser? No install! If the client is updated, the user just F5's and they are up to date.

Why nethack-like? Low graphics requirements! No need for 3-d drivers, nor lighting calculations (which javascript is exceedingly bad at right now).

We're aiming for 4-player co-op, but could probably increase that limit as we go.

The client is just HTML5/JS. The server is currently being done in node.js
